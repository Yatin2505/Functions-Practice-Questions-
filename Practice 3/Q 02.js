/**
 * User Profile and Data Transformation
 * 
 * You have a user profile object. You need to create a function to generate
a personal summary.
1) Create an arrow function named getProfileSummary that accepts a user
object as an argument.
2) The function should return a string that includes the user's name, age, and
location in a readable sentence, for example: "John is 30 years old and
lives in London.â€œ
3) Add a new property to the userProfile object: isLoggedIn with a value of
true.
4) Call the getProfileSummary function, passing the userProfile object, and
print the result to the console.
